this is a GUI front end for RABCDAsm to disasm, reasm, and reinsert modified 
script blocks back into flash files.

it uses the scintinilla control for syntax highlighting.
and rangers hexeditor control for binary data viewing.

I have repos for both or just install pdfstreamdumper which has then too.
