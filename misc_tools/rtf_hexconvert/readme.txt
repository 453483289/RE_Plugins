small tool to extract hex strings from a rtf document and show them in a listview.
click on listitem to see decoded data in a hexeditor pane where you can save it

there is also a button to overwrite all these extracted strings with a null pad
and save the tmp file. this file is just for elminimating noise not for running.

should help hone in on exploit sections of the doc. rtfs can be very noisy

requires the ranger hexeditor ocx control installed with pdfstreamdumper or sysanalyzer
and comctl32.ocx
