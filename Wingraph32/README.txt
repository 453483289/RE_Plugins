About:

  This is another experiment at a wingraph32 replacement for ida.
This one has more features to hide nodes, and can also navigate IDA
to the selected function when you click on it in the graph. 

Uses the AddFlow ocx control trial from Lasalle Technologies. I am 
still evaluating if I want this purchase this control for this project.
There are nags you will have to live with when evaluating the control.

See screen shot for example functionality. Also see test.txt for a sample graph.
