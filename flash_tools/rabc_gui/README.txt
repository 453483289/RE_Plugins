this is a GUI front end for RABCDAsm to modify and reasm flash files.

it uses the scintinilla control scivb_lite.ocx for syntax highlighting.
you can grab it from my repo or just install pdfstreamdumper which has it too.

I JUST switched over to this control from a rich text box..so I still need
some more testing. you can use an exe from an older commit if you have problems.
everything looks stable though from the transition.
