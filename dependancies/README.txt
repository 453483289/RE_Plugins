These are the ocx controls used by the VB sides of these plugins.
I have put them all here for convience, I have not created a install script
yet.

they all have to be registered with regsvr32 as they are activex servers.
additionally there is scivbx.ocx in the IDA_JScript folder. it has to live there
for it to work in the IDE

I have also provided links to downloads of the uDrawGraph and Addflow Trial installers
for the two respective Wingraph32 replacments should you want to try those.
